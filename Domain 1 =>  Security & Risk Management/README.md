### The CIA triad is the foundation of cybersecurity:

1. **Confidentiality ():**  **Keeping it secret, keeping it safe.** This means only authorized people can access your information. 
Example: Your login information (username and password) keeps your account details secret from unauthorized users. It's like having a secret code to access your bank
2. **Integrity (I):**  **Making sure it's accurate.** This ensures your data hasn't been changed or messed with. 
Example: When you check your balance, you trust that the number reflects the actual money in your account. It's like knowing your bank hasn't been tampered with and the coins you counted are still there.
3. **Availability (A):**  **Having it there when you need it.** This means authorized users can access information whenever they need it. 

Example: You expect to be able to access your online bank account anytime you need to check your balance or make a transfer. It's like having easy access to your bank whenever you need to save or take out money.

Remember, cybersecurity is all about protecting your data: keeping it private (confidentiality), accurate (integrity), and accessible (availability).
